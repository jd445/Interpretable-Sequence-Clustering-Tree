# Interpretable-Sequence-Clustering-Tree



## Running
1. First, compile the cpp (use the command $make$) file on your Linux in order to generate the fast Random Projection Generator.
2. Run ISCT to get the clustering results

We recommend using Pypy, which may give exponential speedups on larger datasets

## Dependencies
- Python 3.9.16 (Pypy)
- NumPy 1.24.3
- Scikit-learn 1.2.2
- Pandas 2.0.1
- Prefixspan 0.5.2


## Visualization

ISCT could provide you with a highly concise and short clustering tree, taking poineer as example:
